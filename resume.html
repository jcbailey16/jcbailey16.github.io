					<p><span class="emphasis">Description of Position:</span> As the web programmer intern for <a href="https://ravingsoftware.com" target="_blank">Raving Software</a>,
					my responsibilities included web design, social media management, and developing company processes and practices.</p>
					
					<p>My web design duties include meeting with clients to talk about their business, brand, and goals; designing wireframes 
					and website mock-ups for the client; developing responsive websites for our clients that fit the client's business and 
					help them to achieve their business goals. In addition to client websites, I was also part of the development of the 
					Raving Software company website. The websites I worked on were either strict HTML or developed within the Wordpress framework.</p>
					
					<p>I use my knowledge of social media and marketing to manage the Raving Software social media accounts, and offered advice 
					to clients on which social platforms they should use and how to use them. Part of managing the company's social media 
					accounts includes creating content, such as <a href="writings.html">articles</a> and images.</p>

					Finally, I was involved in developing company processes, such as client on-boarding, the website development process, and 
					the in-person and e-marketing networking processes. </p>

					 took new photos of the products and shop for the website, and set-up an online store using WooCommerce and Paypal, enabling customers

				<h3>Lee Enterprises</h3>
					<p><span class="emphasis">Time of Employment:</span> January 2015 — December 2016</p>
					<p><span class="emphasis">Position:</span> Page Designer</p>
					<p><span class="emphasis">Description of Position:</span> As a newspaper page designer at the Madison Regional Design Center, 
					I used Adobe InDesign and Total Blox CMS to design pages for 30+ newspaper publications. I often produced 15-30 pages per day 
					while working on multiple deadlines and also reviewing colleagues’ pages for copy editing and design errors. A large part of the 
					design process included regular communication with the newspaper editors through email and CISCO Jabber (an instant messaging service) as the 
					editors were located in cities and states across the country. Our communication allowed me to create the best possible design and maintain 
					high quality for the printed product.</p>

					My job was to find stories of people or groups in the community that have not been covered before and write a profile story on them.

					press releases, and life stories/obituaries. </p>
					<p><span class="emphasis">Information Graphic Designer:</span> In the spring semester of 2013, I worked at the paper as information graphic
