				<h3>Lee Enterprises</h3>
					<p><span class="emphasis">Time of Employment:</span> January 2015 — December 2016</p>
					<p><span class="emphasis">Position:</span> Page Designer</p>
					<p><span class="emphasis">Description of Position:</span> As a newspaper page designer at the Madison Regional Design Center, 
					I used Adobe InDesign and Total Blox CMS to design pages for 30+ newspaper publications. I often produced 15-30 pages per day 
					while working on multiple deadlines and also reviewing colleagues’ pages for copy editing and design errors. A large part of the 
					design process included regular communication with the newspaper editors through email and CISCO Jabber (an instant messaging service) as the 
					editors were located in cities and states across the country. Our communication allowed me to create the best possible design and maintain 
					high quality for the printed product.</p>

					press releases, and life stories/obituaries. </p>

					data of the existing publications with which Influence & Co. worked to their CMS, which helped to streamline the process of
