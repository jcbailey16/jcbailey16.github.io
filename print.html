		<p id="intro-graph">On this page, you will find samples of my print design work from when I was a newspaper page
		designer and from a magazine design course I took at the University of Missouri. Due to the nature of the newspaper 
		deadlines and the large volume of pages produced on a nightly basis, I often did not have the time to save work samples 
		before they were deleted from the system. While I only have a few newspaper samples, I regularly designed news, feature, sports, and 
		special sections, including covers.</p>

		<h2>Magazine Design</h2>

					<p class="image-title"> Single Page Redesign (<a href="assets/pdfs/single-page-redesign.pdf" target="_blank">View PDF </a>)</p>
					<p>One of my earliest magazine assignments was to redesign a single page from any magazine of my choice. The 
					original page is on the left, while my redesign is on the right. My choices allowed for more space than what was available on 
					the original page so I added some extra content. While there are things I like about my redesign, there are things I would change. 
					First, I would not be not have the page split between white and red backgrounds. Instead, I would use the red to offset one 
					of the sidebar sections and then move the other to break-up the dialogue. Second, I would rework the folio to take up less space. Honestly, the original layout works well, and I would probably have done something similar.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
					<img src="assets/photostory-cover.jpg" alt="Cover page for my magazine photostory design." class="img-border" style="margin-left:30px;"/>
					<p class="image-title"> Magazine Photostory Design (<a href="assets/pdfs/photostory-design.pdf" target="_blank">View PDF </a>)</p>
					<p>For this assignment, I had to design a four-spread (eight-page) photostory. Overall, I'm still fairly happy with my
					design. The story and photos were provided by my instructor, but everything else is "from scratch." The orange and 
					green colors used throughout were taken from the photo on the first spread. If I were doing this assignment today, I would 
					probably do the photos a little differently so that there was more consistency throughout for both the photo sizes and the columns. 
					You can view the full design by following the PDF link above.</p>

					<img src="assets/concept-design.jpg" alt="Cover page for my magazine photostory design." class="img-border" style="margin-left:30px;"/>
					<p class="image-title"> Concept Design (<a href="assets/pdfs/concept-design.pdf" target="_blank">View PDF </a>)</p>
					<p>While the story was provided for this assignment, we had to come up with the artwork — as a team. Our 
					group illustration, which can be seen on the left page, isn't cohesive. While we agreed on the 
					concept for our main illustration, we weren't clear about how to create the illustrations so the styles would all match. 
					Graphic design is not a strength for me; however, I managed to create the laptop in the main image and the 
					gadgets used in the rest of my design. The most fun I had with this assignment was experimenting with the typefaces used and adding text to the illustrations. 
					It's not my favorite design, but it represents a valuable lesson about designing in teams. You can follow the PDF link above to 
					see the full design.</p>

					<p>My final assignment was to redesign the cover, index page, a department spread, and feature page of a magazine.
					I'm still happy with the cover and index pages, but there are some things I would do differently on the department and 
					feature pages. On the concept page, I would rework a few of the elements so that it all flowed together better. 
					On the feature page, I would redesign the islands. Every element on that page is type, including the arrow going across the top of the page. 
					Were I to design this today, the paths to the islands would be replaced with arrows similar to those across the 
					top of the page. For the islands, I would stick to the word cloud idea used for the states. Follow the PDF link above to see all of the redesign.</p>
