		<p id="intro-graph">On this page, you find samples of my print design work from when I was a newspaper page
		designer and from a magazine design course I took at the University of Missouri. Due to the nature of the newspaper 
		deadlines and the large volume of pages produced on a nightly basis, I often did not have the time to save work samples 
		before they were deleted from the system. While I only have a few newspaper samples, I regularly designed news, feature, and 
		sports sections, including covers and inside pages.</p>

					<p class="image-title"> Single Page Redesign (<a href="assets/pdfs/single-page-redesign.pdf" target="_blank">PDF </a>)</p>
					<p>One of my earliest magazine assignments was to redesign a single page from any magazine of my choice. The 
					original page is on the left, while my redesign is on the right. My choices allowed for more space than what was available on 
					the original page so I added some extra content. While there are things I like about my redesign, there are things I would change. 
					First, I would not be not have the page split between white and red backgrounds. Instead, I would use the red to offset one 
					of the sidebar sections and then move the other to break-up the dialogue. Second, I would rework the folio to take up less space vertically 
					and be more legible. Honestly, the original layout works well, but I had to do something different for the 
					assignment.</p>

					<img src="assets/photostory-cover.jpg" alt="Cover page for my magazine photostory design." class="print-img2"/>
					<p class="image-title"> Magazine Photostory Design (<a href="assets/pdfs/photostory-design.pdf" target="_blank">PDF </a>)</p>
					<p>For this assignment, I had to design a four-spread (eight-page) photostory. Overall, I'm still fairly happy with how this 
					design turned out. The story and photos were provided by my instructor, but everything else is "from scratch." The orange and 
					green colors used throughout were taken from the photo on the first spread. If I were doing this assignment today, I would 
					probably do the photos a little different so that there was more consistency throughout for both the photos and the columns.

					<p class="image-title"> Concept Design (<a href="assets/pdfs/concept-design.pdf" target="_blank">PDF </a>)</p>
					<p>Once again, I was provided with a story to layout and design. However, there were two catches: we had to work 
					in groups and the artwork had to be created by the group. As you can see, our group illustration, which can be seen 
					on the left page, isn't cohesive. While we agreed on the concept for our main illustration, there was a break down 
					in communications about how to create the illustrations. Instead of being created from scratch in either Illustrator 
					or Photoshop, the stack of books was traced and scanned into the computer. For the record, graphic design is not a 
					strength for me. However, I managed to create the laptop in the main image and the gadgets used in the rest of my design 
					(we were all responsible for our own layout, but we had to use the group illustration in it). The most fun I had with this 
					assignment was experimenting with the typefaces used and adding text to the illustrations, which didn't have any 
					type originally. It's not my favorite design, but it represents a valuable lesson about designing in teams. Once again, 
					you can follow the PDF link above to see the full design.</p>

					<img src="assets/magazine-redesign.jpg" alt="Feature page featuring all text elements for my magazine redesign assignment." class="print-img2"/>
					<p class="image-title"> Magazine Redesign (<a href="assets/pdfs/magazine-redesign.pdf" target="_blank">PDF </a>)</p>
					<p>My final and favorite assignment for this course was to redesign the cover, index page, a department spread, and 
					feature page of a magazine. I chose an unusual beach image because it wasn't your typical getaway photo. I thought it would 
					standout on a newsstand when all the spring and summer vacation magazines are using very similar photos. My goal for the index 
					page was to start establishing a brand of through color and font choices, which were used throughout the remaining pages. Once again, 
					I tried to include photos of different kinds of island beaches. </p>
					
					<p>I'm still happy with how the cover turned out, but there are some things I would do differently on the department and 
					feature pages. On the concept page, I would rework the headline, subhead, small third photo and the side bar information. 
					I would drop the sidebar, increase the headline and subhead sizes, and move the third photo into the text and further away from 
					the top of the page. In contrast, I would only change one element on the feature spread: the islands. 
					Every element on that page is type, including the arrow going across the top of the page, and I like how a lot of it turned out. 
					Were I to design this today, I think the paths to the islands would be replaced with arrows similar to what was used going across the 
					top of the page. For the islands, I would do a more word art blurbs with the island name emphasized among activities specific to that 
					island and the review running underneath the island word blurb. Follow the PDF link above to see the first three pages of the redesign.</p>
