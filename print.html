		<p id="intro-graph">On this page, you find samples of my print design work from when I was a newspaper page
		designer and from a magazine design course I took at the University of Missouri. Due to the nature of the newspaper 
		deadlines and the large volume of pages produced on a nightly basis, I often did not have the time to save work samples 
		before they were deleted from the system. While I only have a few newspaper samples, I regularly designed news, feature, and 
		sports sections, including covers and inside pages.</p>
