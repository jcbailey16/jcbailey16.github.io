		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p><a href="#es">Evelyn</a>, <a href="#ah">Alexa</a>, <a href="#sh">Suze</a> and 
		<a href="#sm">Sarah</a> met after being paired up for an English project
		during their junior year (2010) at Jefferson High School, just outside of Chicago. They 
		started meeting after school to write and play music, viewing it more of a hobby 
		than anything serious. By the end of their senior year, the girls decided they 
		would give it a shot. <a href="#lr">Lizzie</a> and <a href="#mj">Morgan</a> joined the group after meeting at a local 
		open mic night, brining a darker sound with them.</p>
		
		<p>The band originally posted its music on Soundcloud, but has since removed it. 
		Some of their early work can be found on the album <span class="band">Beginnings</span>, 
		which can be purchased through the <a href="merchandise.html">official store</a> or 
		<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>. The band's name, chosen after
		a random Wikipedia search has always been the <span class="band">Order 
		of the Swan</span>.</p>

			<p>Eve started taking violin and singing lessons when she was 8. She helps write the lyrics to most of the 
			<span class="band">Order of the Swan</span>'s songs, but leaves the music composition to Lizzie and Sarah. 
			One of her other passions is animal welfare. She spends most of her free time volunteering at animal shelters when 
			she's not with the band or working on her marketing degree.</p>

			<p>Suze has been playing guitar since she was 10, an activity she started to bond more with her mother. Though 
			she enjoys playing and singing, her real love is composition. As the lead composer for the group, she spends a 
			lot of time figuring out how to best weave rock and classical music together in a way that is distinctly theirs.</p>

			<p>Lizzie was taught to play the piano by her father, who has is own unorthodox style. Though she occasionally 
			lends her voice to their songs, Lizzie prefers to play the piano and aid in the lyric and music composition. 
			In her spare time, she teaches children piano and works toward a degree in music education. She is also learning 
			how to play the guitar.</p>

			   <span class="bold_profile">Instagram:</span> <a href="https://www.instagram.com">@SarahSwan</a></p>
			
			<p>Sarah comes from a very musically-inclined family. Jake Mendez, her brother who's a member of the metal group Black Knight, 
			taught her how to play the drums; and her grandmother taught her the harp. Her unique skill set keeps her very busy with the band. 
			Sarah thrives off the chaos of live performances, especially switching instruments mid-performance.</p>

			<p>Morgan picked up music a little later than her bandmates, not starting bass lessons until she was 13. However, 
			her ability grew quickly and soon she was organizing playing sessions for whoever she could get to play with her. 
			She is often called their unofficial manager, as Morgan continues to plan their practice sessions and shows.</p>

			<p>Alexa is the lead guitarist and lyricist for the group. She took piano lessons when she was 6, but switched to
