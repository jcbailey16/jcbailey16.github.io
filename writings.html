				<h3>Developing Your Brand with a Logo</h3>
					<p>You will start to create your company’s brand long before you create a website or any marketing materials. 
					A business’s brand is the image it wants to project to those in and outside of the company. It is informed by 
					the company’s mission, goals, philosophy, practices, products, and services. So before you begin branding, you 
					need to determine what your company is, what your company will do, and the values the company will hold.</p>
