			<h3>Big Blowout</h3>
				<h6>Aired: February 4, 2018</h6>
				<p>As the last Ice Age came to an end, big bubbles of gas on the floor of the Barents Sea popped like champagne corks.

			<h3>Warmer and Smaller</h3>
				<h6>Aired: January 28, 2018</h6>
				<p>Big fish that move fast could lose a bit of their swagger in the coming decades. Warmer ocean waters will provide less oxygen, 
				which could reduce the maximum size of some species of fish -- especially those that are the most active.

			<h3>Musical Mountains</h3>
				<h6>Aired: January 21, 2018</h6>
				<p>In the summer of 2017, a research expedition took a good look at a string of underwater mountains north of Hawaii. 
				Scientists used sonar to map the volcanic mountains, known as seamounts, which formed tens of millions of years ago.

			<h3>Sea Snakes Go Black in City</h3>
				<h6>Posted: February 1, 2018</h6>
				<p>Most turtle-headed sea snakes throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans have black-and-white banded bodies—unless

				<p>Nemo may have been interested in exploring the great big ocean, but his dad Marlin’s attachment to their anemone is the
