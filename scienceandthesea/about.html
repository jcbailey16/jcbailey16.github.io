			<h2>About Us</h2>
			
			<h3>Our Goals</h3>
				
				<br>
				<p><span class="name">Science and the Sea</span> is a production of The University of Texas Marine Science 
				Institute on the Gulf of Mexico in Port Aransas, Texas.</p>
				
				<p>The sea affects our lives in many ways - we relax by its shores and play on its surface, 
				eat of its bounty and enjoy its beauty, it moderates our climate and fuels powerful storms, 
				and it supports an amazingly rich and diverse ecosystem. Researchers know a great deal about 
				how marine life survives and even thrives in the sea, how the sea is critical to human life on 
				the land, and how man affects the vast ocean. </p>
				
				<p>The goal of <span class="name">Science and the Sea</span> is to convey this understanding 
				of the sea and its myriad life forms to everyone, so that they, too, can fully appreciate this 
				amazing resource. We do this through magazine articles, a radio program, and activities on our 
				website. In all of these, we provide entertaining stories and activities that teach about the 
				marine world and even convey how scientists approach, and ultimately solve, some of the oceans' 
				mysteries.</p>
				
				<p>The University of Texas Marine Science Institute began conducting research in 1946 and is the 
				oldest marine laboratory in Texas. Some of the world's premiere marine scientists are based here 
				and their research spans the globe: from the north slope of Alaska to the hydrothermal vents of 
				the South Pacific; from the mangrove forests of Belize to the sea ice of Antarctica; and from the 
				coastal bays and hypersaline lagoons of Texas to the coral reefs of Hawaii. Our graduate program 
				trains future marine scientists through its master's and doctoral degree programs.</p>
				
				<p>The Marine Science Institute is also home to Marine Education Services, a leader in marine 
				education for school children, teachers, visiting college classes, and senior groups. Marine 
				Education Services promotes interest in marine science through educational programs designed 
				especially for teachers, students, and the general public. </p>
