	<div class="summary">
		<p>In an effort to help her overburdened parents, 10-year-old Fanny Price is taken 
		to Mansfield Park to live with her rich Uncle and Aunt Bertram and their four children: 
		Thomas, Edmund, Maria, and Julia.  Though she benefits from her uncle’s wealth, Fanny 
		is never allowed to forget she is not equal to her cousins. With her older cousin Edmund 
		as her only friend, Fanny’s grows up feeling lonely and dreaming of life with her 
		eight siblings in Portsmouth.</p>

		<p>The arrival of siblings Mary and Henry Crawford cause things to change when 
		Fanny is 18. The Crawfords, who are visiting their own aunt and uncle from London, 
		are bored with country life and are desperate for “entertainment.” Fanny’s cousins 
		are immediately drawn to their glamorous and romantic ways, thus becoming the Crawfords’ 
		unwitting prey. The Crawford siblings also force Fanny to struggle between her sense 
		of familial duty and her duty to herself.</p>

		<p>"... in creating a heroine condemned to suffer in secret and powerlessly to 
		watch the follies of others, Austen managed something as audacious as the invention 
		of Elizabeth Bennet." <br> <span class="credit">&mdash; John Mullan, The Guardian</span></p>

	<div id="review3">
		<p>"One doesn’t often turn to Austen for a chill up the spine, but in Mansfield Park, 
		her Georgian clarity is commingled with dread. In a number of these key moments, 
		particularly those in the three scenes I think of as “the theatricals,” something 
		repellent, even demonic, distends the novel’s porcelain skin." <br>

				<p>Jane Austen was born December 16, 1775, in Steventon, Hampshire. Her novels focus on analyzing the social behaviors and rules of the 
				landed gentry, focusing mainly on women’s dependence on marrying for economic security 
				and good social standing. So far, Austen has published six novels: Sense & Sensibility, 
				Pride & Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, and Persuasion.  
				Currently, she is working on an untitled seventh book.</p>

				<p>Though she wrote about the upperclass, Austen’s family was not well off 
				economically. Her father, George, was an Anglican parish rector at Steventon and 
				Deane. He earned a modest income, which was supplemented some by his wife’s, 
				Cassandra’s, small inheritance. However, things were tight with eight children. 
				Despite their financial situation, the Austen home was described as “an open, 
				amused, easy intellectual atmosphere where the ideas of those with whom the Austens 
				might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed.” In other words, 
				it was a good environment for Austen’s literary beginnings.</p>
