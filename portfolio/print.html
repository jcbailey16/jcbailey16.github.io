		<h1>Print Design</h1>
		<p class="intro-graph">On this page, you will find samples of my print design work from when I was a newspaper page
		designer and from a magazine design course I took at the University of Missouri. Due to the nature of the newspaper 
		deadlines and the large volume of pages produced on a nightly basis, I often did not have the time to save work samples 
		before they were deleted from the system. While I only have a few newspaper samples, I regularly designed news, feature, 
		sports, and special sections, including covers.</p>

				<p>One of my earliest magazine assignments was to redesign a single magazine page. The original page is on the left, and my 
				redesign is on the right. My choices allowed for more space than what was available on the original page so I added extra content. 
				While there are things I like about my redesign, there are things I would change.</p>
				<p>First, I would not be not have the page split between white and red backgrounds. Instead, I would use the red to offset one 
				of the sidebar sections and then move the other to break-up the dialogue. Second, I would rework the folio to take up less space. 
				Honestly, the original layout works well, and I would probably do something similar. You can view the full design by clicking on the image title 
				above.</p>

				<img src="assets/photostory-cover.jpg" alt="Cover page for my magazine photostory design."/>
				<div class="read-link2"><a href="assets/pdfs/photostory-design.pdf" target="_blank">Magazine Photostory Design</a></div>
				<p>For this assignment, I had to design a four-spread (eight-page) photostory. Overall, I'm still fairly happy with my
				design. The story and photos were provided by my instructor, but everything else is "from scratch." The orange and 
				green colors used throughout were taken from the photo on the first spread.</p> 
				<p>If I were doing this assignment today, I would probably do the photos a little differently so that there was more 
				consistency throughout for both the photo sizes and the columns. You can view the full design by clicking on the image title above.</p>

				<img src="assets/concept-design.jpg" alt="Cover page for my magazine photostory design."/>
				<div class="read-link2"><a href="assets/pdfs/concept-design.pdf" target="_blank">Concept Design</a></div>
				<p>While the story was provided for this assignment, we had to come up with the artwork â€” as a team. Graphic 
				design is not a strength for me; however, I managed to create the laptop in the main image and the gadgets used in 
				the rest of my design. The most fun I had with this assignment was experimenting with the typefaces used and adding text 
				to the illustrations.</p>
				<p>My biggest critique for the illustrations is that our group illustration, which can be seen on the left page, isn't cohesive. 
				While we agreed on the concept for our main illustration, we weren't clear about how to create the illustrations so the styles 
				would all match. It's not my favorite design, but it represents a valuable lesson about designing in teams. You can view the full 
				design by clicking on the image title above.</p>

				<div class="read-link2"><a href="assets/pdfs/magazine-redesign.pdf" target="_blank">Magazine Redesign</a></div>
				<p>My final assignment was to redesign the cover, index page, a department spread, and feature page of a magazine.
				I'm still happy with the cover and index pages, but there are some things I would do differently on the department and 
				feature pages.</p> 
				
				<p>On the department page, I would rework a few of the elements so that it all flowed together better. On the feature page, 
				I would redesign the islands. Every element on that page is type, including the arrow going across the top of the page. 
				Were I to design this today, the paths to the islands would be replaced with arrows similar to those across the 
				top of the page, and would stick to the word cloud idea used for the states for each island. You can view the full 
				design by clicking on the image title above.</p>
