					<p><span class="emphasis">Position:</span> Front End Engineer</p>
					<p><span class="emphasis">Description of Position:</span> I was hired as web programmer intern for &nbsp;<a href="https://ravingsoftware.com" target="_blank">Raving Software</a>
					in May 2017, and promoted to the Front End Engineer in January 2018. In both positions, I had a wide range of responsibilities.

					websites for clients that fit their businesses and goals. In addition to client websites, I was also part of the development of the 
					Raving Software company website. The websites I worked on were constructed in plain HTML documents or developed within the Wordpress framework.</p>
					
					<p>In addition, I used my knowledge of social media and marketing to manage the Raving Software social media accounts, and offered advice 
					to clients on which social platforms they should use and how to use them. Part of managing the company's social media 
					accounts includes creating content, such as &nbsp;<a href="writings.html">articles</a>&nbsp; and images.</p>

					<p><span class="emphasis">Position:</span> Page Designer</p>
					<p><span class="emphasis">Description of Position:</span> As a newspaper page designer at the Madison Regional Design Center, 
					I used Adobe InDesign and Total Blox CMS to design pages for 30+ newspaper publications. I often produced 15-30 pages per day

					design process included regular communication with the newspaper editors through email and CISCO Jabber (an instant messaging service) as the 
					editors were located in cities and states across the country. Our communication allowed me to create the best possible design for the printed product.</p>
