				<h3>Raving Software Website</h3>
				<p>Raving Software is a web design company I have worked at since 2017. My responsibilities include planning, 
				designing, and coding websites for our clients and for the company's website.<br><br> The Raving Software website is as an HTML-based site, 
				but we have plans to rebuild it as a WordPress website as part of a rebrand and for easier management and updates. 
				All client websites made for Raving Software are created within the WordPress framework. We use the Divi theme as our 
				base and customized child themes for our clients.</p>

				<h3>Marie Chantal's Bakery Website</h3>
				<p>For Marie Chantal's Bakery, we developed a theme through establishing a color scheme, font choices, and repeated elements. 
				In addition, we improved her online ordering and reviewing processes, and trained the client on how to update her photo galleries 
				and the image slider, and how to manage reviews submitted via the website.</p>

			<div class="txt-content" id="tdc-site">
				<h3>The Delightful Cupcake Website</h3>
				<p>This Delightful Cupcake is a website I built as a theme example for Raving Software. We wanted to showcase our abilities and 
				give clients an idea of what we could do for their website. Having examples of other websites helps the client to figure out what they like, 
				don't like, and what might work best for their business needs.</p>

			<div class="txt-content" id="sss-site">
				<h3>Silver Star Service Center, Inc. Website</h3>
				<p>We built the Silver Star Service Center site to assist in the business's workflow by incorporating service appointment scheduling, 
				a vehicle sales section, an on-site customer rating capability, and customer contact forms. The client can manage all of these function 
				through the Wordpress CMS.</p>

			<div class="txt-content" id="cdn-site">
				<h3>Casa Della Nonna Website</h3>
				<p>This single-page website was a class project where I had to reimagine a local restaurant's printed menu as a website. The site is 
				mobilized, though I would go back and fix the H1 headline size as it takes up too much space vertically when the browser window is small. 
				Other than that, I'm happy with how this website turned out, and think this project was a good for practicing hierarchy. (AACC project)</p>

			<div class="txt-content" id="type-site">
				<h3>Type and Positioning Web Page</h3>
				<p>For this web page, I had to choose a typeface and design a digital typeface poster than conveyed it's personality. I chose the 
				Google Font Alegreya and used shapes and text, per the assignment requirements, to create a page of an open book. I chose to 
				create a book because the font was designed for works of literature. (AACC project)</p>	
			</div><!--end of txt-content-->
			
			<div class="txt-content" id="explore-site">
				<h3>Explore: Get Out &amp; Go Website</h3>
				<p>As a final project, I designed a multi-page, responsive website. I designed and developed a website 
				that provides people with activities to do in the Baltimore-Annapolis-D.C. area. Certain elements, 
				such as tables, lists, and contact forms, had to be utilized in the website. <br><br>Besides the requirements, I had complete 
				control over the creative choices. I used my own photos or created graphics for the website where I could, and used 
				Creative Common licensed photos for the rest. The background is a repeated image of the blue color that 
				I texturized in PhotoShop. There's a back-up background of the solid color blue in case the images can't load. (AACC project)</p>

			<div class="txt-content" id="paws-site">
				<h3>Friends with Paws Website</h3>
				<p>Another class also required a multi-page, responsive website for a final assignment. Instead of reusing my 
				"Explore" website, I created an animal shelter that offered veterinarian services as well.
				Because the design and behavior of a web page is determined by the content, I made it a goal to use "real" content instead of filler text. 
				This attention to detail lead to my summer internship at The Twisted Bead &amp; Rock Shop and my position with Raving Software. 
				<br><br>While this website does mobilize, it doesn't execute 
				as well as I would like. The structure I used for the "Explore" website worked much better than what I did for this one. I have since had 
				more real-world experience and taken a class that focuses on responsive design, and have improved my responsive coding and planning. (AACC project)</p>

			<div class="txt-content" id="sats-site">
				<h3>Science and the Sea Website</h3>
				<p>The purpose of this assignment was to rebrand an existing podcast website and make it responsive. I started 
				building the site at 320px and decided on media query breakpoints when the content started to look bad at a certain 
				width. The new technique used here was image swapping using the picture element, source tag, and media queries to 
				apply an appropriately sized and cropped image. <br><br>I'm happy with how this website looks on small to medium-size 
				screens, however there are some sizing issues on large screens that I needed to work on a bit more to keep content (text) from 
				getting too wide. (AACC project)</p>		
			</div><!--end of txt-content-->
			
			<div class="txt-content" id="np-site">
				<h3>Novel! Publishing Website</h3>
				<p>For this assignment, I had to come up with a product to sell and a fake company in order to implement a 
				checkout workflow using online forms. In addition to using forms, this responsive site experimented with 
				HDPI images and flex display. I created a small publishing company that focuses on the Young Adult genre. <br><br>There 
				are some positioning issues at larger screen sizes, but, overall, it looks and functions pretty well. Currently, 
				the forms do not function (accept input, validate, etc.), as that was outside the scope of this assignment, but it is something 
				I may go back and work on at a later time. (AACC project)</p>	
			</div><!--end of txt-content-->
			
			<div class="txt-content" id="typo-site">
				<h3>Typographics Conference Website</h3>
				<p>This was a final project for my responsive web design class in which we combined all the techniques 
				we had learned throughout the semester: image swapping, HDPI images, SVG's, forms, and flex display. The assignment 
				was to create a conference website for Typographics, who was our client. I was given the text content and most of the artwork, but 
				was responsible for creating a brand and logo for the website. <br><br>I'm really happy with how this website turned out. 
				I structured and styled my pages in a way that a lot of my positioning and sizing issues from earlier assignments 
				were not an issue this time around. What did I do differently? I started implementing max-widths on photos and paragraph 
				elements. <br><br>In addition, I used jQuery to create a drop-down menu and modals for the workshops, tours, and bookseller details. 
				Everything does work, as long as JavaScript is enabled on the device. One of my goals is to learn alternatives to JavaScript so 
				that if a device doesn't have it enabled, a function or effect can still execute. (AACC project)</p>
