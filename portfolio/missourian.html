		<h1>Columbia Missourian Articles</h1>
		<p class="intro-graph">The Columbia Missourian is a city newspaper owned by the University of Missouri and run 
		by the faculty and students of the School of Journalism. The paper is one of the ways the journalism school executes 
		The Missouri Method, which is a learning style that emphasizes and encourages hands-on and real-world experience as 
		part of the "classroom" experience.</p> 
		
		<p class="intro-graph">As a reporter for the Missourian, I worked on Community beat where I wrote profiles on 
		unknown people or groups in the community, as well as worked as a general assignment reporter. You can click the 
		links to read the full articles.<br><br>
		
		PDFs of my work can be sent via email if a link is broken or the article has been placed behind a pay wall.</p>
