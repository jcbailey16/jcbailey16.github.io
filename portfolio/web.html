		<h1>Web Design</h1>
		<p class="intro-graph">On this page, you will find samples of my website design work as a front-end engineer at Raving 
		Software, as well as a handful of school projects completed while I was a student at AACC. I am including samples from 
		both sources to show a range of my abilities.</p>

				<p>Raving Software is a web design company I worked at from 2017 - 2018. Part of my responsibilities included planning, 
				designing, and coding websites for our clients and for the company's website. The Raving Software website started as an HTML-based site, 
				but we converted it to a WordPress website for easier management and updates, and to be maintain a consistent look between the blog and 
				static informative content. All client websites made for Raving Software were created within the WordPress framework.</p>

				<p>For this small bakery, we developed a theme through establishing a color scheme, font choices, and repeated elements. 
				In addition, we improved her online ordering and reviewing processes, and trained the client on how to update her photo galleries 
				and the image slide, and how to manage reviews submitted via the website.</p>

				<p>This is a website I built on my own as a theme example for Raving Software. We wanted to showcase our abilities and 
				give clients an idea of what we could do for their website. Having examples of other websites helps the client to figure out what they do, 
				don't like, and what might work best for their business needs.</p>

				<div class="read-link2"><a href="http://silverstarservice.com/" target="_blank">Silver Star Service Center, Inc.</a></div>
				<p>We built the website to assist in the business's workflow by incorporating service appointment scheduling, a vehicle sales section, an 
				on-site customer rating capability, and customer contact forms, all of which can be accessed by the client through the Wordpress CMS.</p>

				<div class="image-title">Casa Della Nonna</div>
				<p>This is a single-page website for a local restaurant's menu. The site is mobilized, though I would go back and fix 
				the H1 headline size as it takes up too much space vertically when the browser window is small. Other than that, I'm 
				happy with how this website turned out. (AACC project)</p>

				<img src="assets/typography.jpg" alt="Type and Positioning Example web page"/>
				<div class="image-title">Type and Positioning Web Page</div>
				<p>For this web page, I had to choose a typeface and design a digital typeface poster than conveyed it's personality. I chose the 
				Google Font of Alegreya and used shapes and text, per the assignment requirements, to create a page of an open book. I chose to 
				create a book because the font was designed for works of literature. (AACC project)</p>

			<div class="work-display-content">
				<img src="assets/explore.jpg" alt="Explore home page"/>
				<div class="image-title">Explore: Get Out and Go</div>
				<p>As a final project, I designed a multi-page and responsive website. I chose to build a website 
				that would focus on providing people with activities to do in the Baltimore-Annapolis-D.C. area. Certain elements, 
				such as tables, lists, and contact forms, had to be utilized in the website. Besides the requirements, I had complete 
				control over the creative choices. I used my own photos or created graphics for the website where I could, and used 
				Creative Common licensed photos for the rest. The background is actually a repeated image of the blue color that 
				I texturized in PhotoShop. There's a back-up background of the solid color blue in case the images can't load. (AACC project)</p>

				<div class="image-title">Friends with Paws</div>
				<p>Another class also required a multi-page, responsive website for a final assignment. Instead of reusing my 
				"Explore" website, I decided to do another one from scratch. While it does mobilize, it doesn't execute 
				as well as I would like. The structure I used for the "Explore" website worked much better than what I did for this one. I have since had 
				more real-world experience and taken a class that focuses on responsive design, and improved my responsive coding and planning. (AACC project)</p>

				<img src="assets/sciencesea.png" alt="Science and the Sea home page"/>
				<div class="image-title">Science and the Sea</div>
				<p>The purpose of this assignment was to rebrand an existing podcast website and make it responsive. I started 
				building the site at 320px and decided on media query breakpoints when the content started to look bad at a certain 
				width. The new technique used here was image swapping using the picture element, source tag, and media queries to 
				apply an appropriately sized and cropped image. I'm happy with how this website looks on small to medium-size 
				screens, however there are some sizing issues on large screens that I needed to work on a bit more to keep content from 
				getting too wide.(AACC project)</p>

			<div class="work-display-content">
				<img src="assets/novelpub.png" alt="Science and the Sea home page"/>
				<div class="image-title">Novel! Publications</div>
				<p>For this assignment, I had to come up with a product to sell and a fake company in order to implement a 
				checkout workflow using online forms. In addition to using forms, this responsive site experimented with 
				HDPI images and flex display. I created a small publishing company that focuses on the Young Adult genre. There 
				are some positioning issues at larger screen sizes, but, overall, it looks and functions pretty well. Currently, 
				the forms do not function (accept input, validate, etc.), as that was outside the scope of this assignment, but it is something 
				I may go back and work on at a later time. (AACC project)</p>

			<div class="work-display-content">
				<img src="assets/typographics.png" alt="Science and the Sea home page"/>
				<div class="image-title">Typographics</div>
				<p>This was a final project for my responsive web design class in which we combined all the techniques 
				we had learned throughout the semester: image swapping, HDPI images, SVG's, forms, and flex display. The assignment 
				was to create a conference website for Typographics. I was given the text content and most of the artwork, but 
				was responsible for creating a brand and logo for the website. I'm really happy with how this website turned out. 
				I structured and styled my pages in a way that a lot of my positioning and sizing issues from earlier assignments 
				were not an issue this time around. What did I do differently? I started implementing max-widths on photos and paragraph 
				elements. In addition, I used jQuery to create a drop-down menu and modals for the workshops, tours, and bookseller details. 
				Everything does work, as long as JavaScript is enabled on the device. One of my goals is to learn alternatives to JavaScript so 
				that if a device doesn't have it enabled, a function or effect can still execute. (AACC project)</p>
