				<h3>Missouri Energy Providers</h3>
				<p>The graphs show the total electricity production capacity breakdown by fuel 
				type in 2011 for three of Missouri's biggest energy providers: Empire District 
				Electric Co., Kansas City Power &amp; Light, and Ameren Missouri. Utilities do not 
				always produce energy at full capacity. If each company was generating and purchasing 
				electricity at full capacity in 2011, the following percentages of energy would come 
				from each type of fuel. The maps show the areas each of the companies service in 
				Missouri.</p>
				
				<p>This infographic was a group effort between myself and two other 
				students. Overall it was an easy collaboration as we mainly had to agree on 
				and stick to the same color palate for the graphic's key. Each person worked 
				on respresenting the requested data for one energy provider. I worked on Kansas 
				City Power and Light's data. Though a relatively simple graphic, the locator map 
				was challenging in that the services areas did not neatly stay within the counties. 
				However, replicating the service area allowed me to practice with the Illustrator 
				pen tool when I first learning how to use the software.</p>

				<h3>College Avenue Median</h3>
				<p>College Avenue is a major road in Columbia, Missouri, that borders on side of the 
				university. Various types of student housing was located across the street from the 
				campus. Often, students would cross at any point along the way to get home and stand 
				in the road as they waited for it to be clear to continue crossing. The City Council 
				authorized funds to go towards making the road safer for everyone. In addition to 
				adding two crosswalks to the stretch of road that borders the main campus, they project 
				included a median to prevent pedestrians from crossing anywhere along the road.</p>
				
				<p>This was one of many locator maps I made as an infographic designer for the Missourian. 
				The print version, seen here, was straightforward to make. The online version provided more of 
				a challenges as we (myself and the TA) tried to make it interactive so the explanations would 
				show when each number was hovered over. This was ultimately achieved by using Flash.</p>

				<h3>Notable Properties in Columbia, Missouri</h3>
				<p>This infographic shows some of the Historic Preservation Commission's 2013 list of Most 
				Notable Places in Columbia, Missouri. The properties shown here are located in downtown 
				Columbia. At the time, the Niedermeyer Apartments were up for sale and many in the city 
				were fighting to have it saved. The building was the oldest building in downtown Columbia and 
				many did not want it to be demolished.</p>
				
				<p>This was one of two infographics I did for this story. This particular piece ran alongside a 
				piece that discussed the history of the notable properties for 2013.</p>

				<h3>The Niedermeyer Building</h3>
				<p>This infographic ran with a follow-up story to the initial news the Niedermeyer Apartments 
				were up for sale and in danger of being demolished. The graphic was meant to show readers 
				where the building was located in downtown Columbia both with street names and popular 
				nearby businesses readers would be familiar with.</p>
				
				<p>The building was ultimately sold to Nakhle Asmar, an MU mathematics professor, who immediately 
				set to work on fixing up the apartments. As of 2018, the apartments were still standing.

				<h3>Sinkholes: Nature's Disappearing Act</h3>
				<p>Unlike the other showcased infographics, this one was not requested to run alongside a story. Instead, 
				it is a final project that was compiled to run as a feature piece in the Missourian over the summer. This 
				assignment required three components of which one had to be interactive.</p>
				
				<p>The topic of my project is sinkholes, chosen for a number of occurrences that had taken place in Midwest 
				that spring. My elements included the stages of sinkhole formation, a map of the U.S. that shows the states 
				where sinkholes are common, and a sinkhole density map of Missouri with facts about sinkholes. In the online version, 
				the stages we presented in a JavaScript-enabled slideshow, and the sinkhole facts showed when different areas of 
				the sinkhole density map of Missouri were hovered on.</p>
