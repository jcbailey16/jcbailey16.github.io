		<h3>The blog is up!</h3>
		<p>Our <a href="https://friendswithpawsblog.wordpress.com">blog</a> is finally up 
		and running. We’ll be up-dating 2-3 times a week with posts from our fun and 
		dedicated staff. Topics will range from health concerns to training tips to (pet) life hacks.</p>
		<p>We are very excited to have added a blog to our social media presence. It will be 
		a great way to connect with the community and provide a source of reliable information. 
		We know there are a lot of websites out there, and we want to give accurate information 
		in regards to dog breeds, pet care, and training.</p>
		<p>Have a question or blog suggestion? Send us an <a href="mailto:contactus@friendswpaws.com">
		email</a>. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

		eligible for a tax write off, so bring them in before April 18.</p>

		will get a $50 gift card to T.G.I. Friday's.</p>

		Make sure to tag us (@FriendswPaws) and use the hashtag "#EasterPets" so we see your entry.
