	you can volunteer, foster an animal, see the vet, and even get your pet groomed. However, 
	due to our small staff, we require appointments to be made ahead of time for most of our 
	services. You can do so by calling our office at 401-123-4567 or 
	<a href="mailto:contactus@friendswpaws.com">emailing</a> us with the requested service 
	in the subject line. Below are some of our services:

	<p>We take in a lot of rescues at our shelter. Sadly, they don't always come to us in 
	the best condition. These animals often need extra care and attention before they can be 
	adopted. That's where are foster homes come in.</p>
	
	<p>In foster homes, these animals can be rehabilitated to be family pets. Foster "parents" 
	work the animal to get them comfortable around people and work on behavior training. This 
	experience also allows to figure out the best type of forever home for these animals.</p>
	
	<p>If you are interested in becoming a foster parent, please fill read and fill out our 
	<a href="assets/resume3.pdf">Foster Pet Parent</a> application and drop it off at our office 
	at your earliest convenience. We aim to keep costs low for our foster families, so food, 
	medical services, some pet supplies are provided by the shelter. You are welcome to buy 
	your own supplies for your foster pet.</p>
