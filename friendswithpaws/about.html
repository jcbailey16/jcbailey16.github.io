	<h1>About Us</h1>
	
	<p>Friends with Paws started in 1996 in a small building just off Annapolis. Originally, 
	we could only house 70 dogs and cats at a time. Today, our facility can hold up to 200 animals, 
	including dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, gerbils and other small pets. We are a non-profit,
	no-kill shelter. All money from adoptions, veterinarian care, and fundraisers goes back 
	to the shelter to take care of the animals and maintain the staff and facilities.</p>

		<p>Looking for pet tips or (pet)life hacks? Wondering if a pet's behavior is a 
		sign of illness? We have the answers!</p>
		
		<p>Our <a href="https://friendswithpawsblog.wordpress.com">blog</a> is updated once or twice a week by our staff members. From health 
		information to training tips, we have you covered.</p>
		
		<p>Don't see a topic or have a suggestion? Send us an <a href="mailto:contactus@friendswpaws.com">
		email</a> or fill our <a href="#form">contact form</a>. We look forward to hearing 
		from you.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Our mission is to find a forever home for every animal in our facility and to educate 
	the community about proper animal care. A lot of animals that come through our doors are 
	from homes where their owners didn't realize everything that went into keeping a pet. 
	To fight this, we host pet care forums and welcome the public to join us for in-house 
	dog training sessions (you can bring your own dog or work with one of ours). We believe 
	the more knowledge people have, the less overwhelming it will be when they bring home a 
	new pet.</p>
	
	<p>We have an amazing staff, from experienced veterinarians and vet techs to a dedicated 
	management and front office staff. That said, volunteers are our life blood. We would 
	not be half as success as we are without our volunteers. We know life can be chaotic so 
	we accept <a href="volunteer.html">volunteers</a> all the time. We don't have time 
	requirements and only ask for at least 24 hours notice if you're unable to make your 
	shift. All of us at Friends with Paws look forward to seeing you, especially our furry 
	residents.</p>
	
	<p>We are opened Monday through Friday from 10am to 6pm, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. 
	We are closed on holidays.</p>
	
	<h2>Our Staff</h2>

	<h3>Dr. Lillian Thomas</h3>
	<p>Dr. Thomas has been us from the beginning. She has 20 years experience as a 
	veterinarian. She loves her work and her patients. Dr. Thomas believes in quality care 
	so she is available during office hours Monday through Friday, and can be contacted by 
	<a href="mailto:contactus@friendswpaws.com">email</a>. Dr. Thomas currently has two dogs 
	and a cat, so she understands what it means to be a concerned pet parent.</p>
	
	<h3>Dr. Luke Matthews</h3>
	<p>Dr. Matthews is a new, but loved, addition at Friends with Paws. After finishing school 
	in Missouri, he moved out to Maryland to be closer to his grandparents. He works the

	<h3>Tech Melissa Andrews</h3>
	<p>Tech Andrews has been with us for five years, and has decided to go back to school

	<h3>Tech Dave Smith</h3>
	<p>Tech Smith just started with us in April and we are happy to welcome him to the shelter. 
	He and his 9-year-old boxer mix, Toffee, just moved to Odenton from Woodbridge, VA. In his 
	spare time, the two have been exploring the area's hiking trails. He also enjoys camping and 
	kayaking, and is looking forward to all the outdoor summer activities.</p>

	<h3>Maggie John</h3>
	<p>Maggie is our office manager and a paperwork wiz! From schedules to forms, she does it 
	all. We'd honestly be lost without her. She's always on-hand to answer a question or help 
	you fill out paperwork. Maggie also co-leads our volunteer program. If you have any questions,
	she'll be happy to answer them.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Jennifer Bailey</h3>
	<p>Jennifer is our web designer and social media manager. She was a newspaper page designer 
	for two years in Wisconsin before moving to Maryland and working toward a degree 
	in web development at AACC. Samples of her work can be viewed on her <a href="jennbailey16.wordpress.com">
	personal blog</a>.</p>
