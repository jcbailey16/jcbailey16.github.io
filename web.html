					<p class="image-title">Raving Software (<a href="https://ravingsoftware.com/" target="_blank">View Site </a>)</p>
					<p class="web-descript">Raving Software is a web design company I worked at from 2017 - 2018. Part of 
					my responsibilities were planning, designing, and coding websites for our clients and for the company's website. 
					All the other websites listed in the "Raving Software" section are either in-house or client websites.</p>

					<p class="image-title">Marie Chantal's Bakery (<a href="https://www.mariechantalsbakery.com/" target="_blank">View Site </a>)</p>
					<p class="web-descript">For this small bakery, we developed a theme through establishing a color scheme, 
					font choices, and repeated elements. In addition, we improved her online ordering and reviewing processes, and trained the 
					client on how to update her photo galleries and the image slide, and how to manage reviews submitted via the website.</p>

					<p class="image-title">The Delightful Cupcake (<a href="https://www.delightfulcupcake.com/" target="_blank">View Site </a>)</p>
					<p class="web-descript">This is a website I built on my own as a theme example for Raving Software. We wanted to showcase our abilities and 
					give clients an idea of what we could do for their website. Having examples of other websites helps the client to figure out what they do and don't 
					like, and what might work best for their business needs.</p>

					<p class="image-title">Silver Star Service Center, Inc. (<a href="http://silverstarservice.com/" target="_blank">View Site </a>)</p>
					<p class="web-descript">We built the website to assist in the business's workflow by incorporating service appointment scheduling, 
					a vehicle sales section, a customer rating capaiblity and customer contact forms, all of which can be accessed by the client 
					through the Wordpress CMS. In addition to improving workflow, we created copy and artwork for the website to make it visually appealing and 
					informative for customers.</p>

		<h2>Anne Arundel Community College</h2>
			<p class="explanation">For my Internet Applications Development degree, I took courses in HTML and CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, 
			PHP and mySQL, and Java. I have selected a few examples of my work to show where I started and my progress. I took my first web 
			design course in 2013 at the University of Missouri, but had not done any web work since.</p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<a href="casadellanonna/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="assets/cdn-menu.jpg" class="img-border" alt="The Casa Della Nonna website." style="margin-left:30px;"/></a>
					<p class="image-title">Casa Della Nonna (<a href="assets/pdfs/restaurant-menu.pdf" target="_blank">View PDF of Site </a>)</p>
					<p class="web-descript">This is a single-page website for a local restaurant's menu. The site is mobilized, though I would go back and fix 
					the H1 headline size as it takes up too much space vertically when the browser window is small. Other than that, I'm 
					happy with how this website turned out.</p>
				</div>	
				
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<a href="orderoftheswan/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="assets/orderoftheswan.jpg" class="img-border" alt="The Order of the Swan home page" style="margin-left:30px;"/></a>
					<p class="image-title">Order of the Swan (<a href="assets/pdfs/orderoftheswan.pdf" target="_blank">View PDF of Site </a>)</p>
					<p class="web-descript">This website was created for a fake band. All the creative decisions were left up to me, except 
					for the band name and three images that were all pulled from a random search on Wikipedia. I had a lot of fun working on this 
					website and creating a tone and content for my fake band. The site is not mobilized, but I would go back and use Bootstrap and 
					media queries to make it mobile-friendly.</p>

					<a href="type-and-positioning.html" target="_blank"><img src="assets/type.jpg" class="img-border" alt="Type and Positioning Example web page" style="margin-left:30px;"/></a>
					<p class="image-title">Type and Positioning Web Page (<a href="type-and-positioning.html" target="_blank">View Page </a>)</p>
					<p class="web-descript">For this web page, I had to choose a typeface and design a digital typeface poster than conveyed it's personality. I chose the 
					Google Font of Alegreya and used shapes and text, per the assignment requirements, to create a page of an open book. I chose to create a book 
					because the font was designed for works of literature.</p>
				</div>	
				
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<a href="book/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="assets/mansfieldpark.jpg" class="img-border" alt="Favorite book website" style="margin-left:30px;"/></a>
					<p class="image-title">Favorite Book with JavaScript Scrolling (<a href="assets/pdfs/favorite-book.pdf" target="_blank">View PDF of Site </a>)</p>
					<p class="web-descript">This website was an introduction to JavaScript. I had to create a web page 
					for my favorite book and its author. I chose to do "Mansfield Park" by Jane Austen because I figured it was not one that would be 
					done by a lot of people. I like how this page turned out, but there are a few positioning elements that I would work on.</p>

					<a href="explore/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="assets/explore.jpg" class="img-border" alt="Explore home page" style="margin-left:30px;"/></a>
					<p class="image-title">Explore: Get Out and Go (<a href="explore/index.html" target="_blank">View Site </a>)</p>
					<p class="web-descript">As a final project, I designed a multi-page, mobilized website. I chose to build a website 
					that would focus on providing people with activities to do in the Baltimore-Annapolis-D.C. area. Certain elements, 
					such as tables, lists, and contact forms, had to be utilized in the website. Besides the requirements, I had complete 
					control over the creative choices. I used my own photos or created graphics for the website where I could, and used 
					Creative Common licensed photos for the rest. The background is actually a repeated image of the blue color that I texturized 
					in PhotoShop. There's a back-up background of the solid color blue in case the images can't load.</p>

					<a href="friendswithpaws/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="assets/friendswithpaws.jpg" class="img-border" alt="Friends with Paws home page" style="margin-left:30px;"/></a>
					<p class="image-title">Friends with Paws (<a href="friendswithpaws/index.html" target="_blank">View Site </a>)</p>
					<p class="web-descript">Another class also required a multi-page, mobilized website for a final assignment. Instead of reusing my 
					"Explore" website, I decided to do another one from scratch. While it does mobilize, it doesn't execute 
					as well as I would like. The structure I used for the "Explore" website worked much better than what I did for this one. One of my 
					current classes focuses on responsive design so I'm hoping to improve these skills throughout the semester. Note that the blog has been 
					deleted, but once linked to a Wordpress blog for the Friends with Paws veterinary service.</p>
