		<h1>About...</h1>
		
		<h2>This Website</h2>
		<div class="bio">
			<p>This website is a portfolio of my work. However, it will not be "static." In addition to keeping it 
			up-to-date with my latest projects, I will work on maintenance and other behind-the-scenes tasks. This will include 
			making sure the site works on mobile devices, copyediting as necessary, etc. Since I plan to work regularly on improving 
			this site, constructive criticism is welcome.</p>

		<h2>My Journey to Web Design and Development</h2>
		
		<div class="bio">
			
			<h3>The Beginning</h3>
			<p>Writing was my first real passion. I always loved my English classes, and have been writing my own stories 
			since elementary school. By the time I started high school, I was trying to figure out how I could build a 
			career around writing. I joined my high school newspaper and yearbook staffs, where I was introduced to 
			reporting, news writing, and print design. The faculty advisor for these staffs took us to camps, conferences, and 
			competitions so we could learn new techniques from our fellow students and industry professionals. During this 
			time, my interest started shifting from reporting to news design, and I actually placed for news page design at regional, 
			state, and national level competitions. By the fall of my senior year, I had decided to go to the University of Missouri 
			and pursue a degree in journalism.</p>
			
			<h3>The College Years</h3>
			<p>Before freshmen year was over, I knew I would not be pursuing reporting as a career. Instead, I would complete the Multiplatform 
			Design emphasis area, which focused on news design for newspapers, magazines, and websites. Several things about my degree planned 
			changed over the years, but my desire to design a platform that drew people's attention to the news content remained. In the fall of 
			2013, I took my first web design course. I loved it. Prior to this course, I had only considered working at newspapers or magazines. 
			After the course, I knew I had to include web design in my future.</p>
			
			<p>In my second year, I decided to earn a Bachelor's of Science and Business Administration with an emphasis in marketing, as well. 
			Honestly, this degree was added as back-up to ease my parents' worry that the "journalism thing" was not going to work. However, 
			the marketing courses I took complemented my courses in the journalism school. Where one taught me how to create content, the other 
			covered how to get people to see or interact with it. In addition, I took courses about accounting, finance, and management which left 
			with a working knowledge of the non-creative side of business — something a lot of creatives and (young) journalists don't really have. 
			My interest in marketing actually grew to the point where I had planned to pursue an MBA in market research.</p>
			
			<h3>The First Job</h3>
			<p>However, I scrapped the plan to pursue an MBA. By the time it came to start preparing for graduate school applications, my interest had waned 
			and I was burned out from 4.5 years (summers included) of undergrad. Instead, I completed my bachelor programs, graduated in December 2014, 
			and promptly moved to Madison, Wisconsin. In Madison, I worked at the Lee Enterprises's Madison Regional Design Center as a news page design. 
			I held this position for two years while trying to build my web design skills on my own time through online services such as Codecademy and Code 
			School. While I loved a lot about my job, I reached the point where it was time to move on. There weren't a lot of opportunities to grow 
			and no opportunities to work on the news websites. I decided it was time to go back to school.</p>
			
			<h3>The Return</h3>
			<p>I started my course work at Anne Arundel Community College in January 2017. Since last year, I have taken classes 
			introducing me to HTML and CSS, responsive web design, PHP and mySQL, Java, JavaScript, and jQuery. All of these courses have 
			taken a hands-on approach so I have created 10+ multi-page websites for my web design classes and small applications for my 
			programming ones. I will graduate in May 2018 with a Computer Science Associate's degree in Internet Applications Development.</p>
			
			<p>In addition to school, I worked as a freelance web designer for a local business during the summer of 2017 and have been 
			employed at a start-up web design and software company since May 2017. In this position, I have planned and built websites for 
			the company's clients, helped create the company's website, managed online and offline marketing efforts, and been involved in 
			establishing company processes and procedures. I've loved having the opportunity to use my background in journalism (writing and 
			content creation) with marketing (social media and e-marketing campaigns) with my web design and development skills.</p>
			
			<h3>The Present</h3>
			<p>Web design and development can be as frustrating as it is fun, but that's why I love it. There's always something new to learn. 
			I like knowing that, whatever I do in the design and development world, I won't be bored. I don't have a clear path for my future, but 
			I do know I want to design websites (or even applications) that are accessible and provide positive user experiences, especially when 
			the website is reliant on a database for user interactions. Currently, my goal is to get more experience with front-end and back-end 
			programming languages so that I can work in different areas of web and application development.</p>
