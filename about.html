		<h1>About...</h1>
		
		<h2>This Website</h2>
		<div class="bio">
			<p>This website is a portfolio of my work.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>My Education and Work Experience</h2>
		
		<div class="bio">
			<p>I graduated from the University of Missouri in December 2014 with bachelor degrees in journalism and business. 
			My journalism degree has an emphasis in multiplatform design, or designing across print and digital mediums, while 
			my business degree has an emphasis in marketing. After graduating, I became a newspaper design at the Lee Enterprises 
			Regional Design Center in Madison, Wisconsin. I held this position for two years before deciding to go back to school 
			and focus on web design and development. </p>
		
			<p>I started my course work at Anne Arundel Community College in January 2017. Since last year, I have taken classes 
			introducing me to HTML and CSS, responsive web design, PHP and mySQL, Java, JavaScript, and jQuery. All of these courses have 
			taken a hands-on approach so I have created 10+ multi-page websites for my web design classes and small applications for my 
			programming ones. I will graduate in May 2018 with a Computer Science Associate's degree in Internet Applications Development.</p>
		
			<p>In addition to school, I worked as a freelance web designer for a local business during the summer of 2017 and have been 
			employed a start-up web design and software company since May 2017. In this position, I have planned and built websites for 
			the company's clients, helped create the company's website, managed online and offline marketing efforts, 
			and been involved in establishing company processes and procedures.</p>
		</div>
				
		<h2>My Professional Goals</h2>
		<div class="bio">
			<p>My professional goals are, honestly, a bit vague. After graduating, I would like to find a full-time position where I have 
			the opportunity to expand my programming skills. I'm not opposed to having a position that involves creating content, such as 
			writing blog posts, but I would like to do less of it. I enjoy designing websites. However, I'm also interested in improving the 
			accessibility and user experience of websites and applications. My goal is to get more experience with front-end and back-end 
			programming languages so that I can work in different areas of web and application development.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>My Personal Life and Goals</h2>
		<div class="bio">
			<p>I was born in Arizona, but moved to California not long after. Why? My dad is in the military; we moved a lot. As of today, 
			I have lived in 12 states and 2 countries. While I'm a pro at moving, it's not necessarily my favorite activity. I would rather 
			travel, and hope I'll be able to do more traveling one day. Despite living in Germany for three years, there are still many things and 
			places I would like to see.When I get some free time from school and work, I enjoy spending time with my family, friends, and dog, 
			binge-watching TV shows, reading (I'm currently working toward reading 50 new books this year), and writing.</p>
