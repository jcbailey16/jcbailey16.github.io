	<h3>	<img class="iconsmall" src="assets/compass.gif" alt="compass logo">Come see 'Something Rotten"</h3>
	<p>We have 10 tickets for the April 23 performance of "Something Rotten" at the Hippodrome 
	Theater in Baltimore. </p>
	<p>From New York Magazine: "Set in 1595, this hilarious smash tells the story of Nick 
	and Nigel Bottom, two brothers who are desperate to write a hit play. When a local 
	soothsayer foretells that the future of theatre involves singing, dancing and acting 
	at the same time, Nick and Nigel set out to write the world’s very first MUSICAL! 
	With its heart on its ruffled sleeve and sequins in its soul, Something Rotten! is 
	“The Producers = The Book of Mormon x The Drowsy Chaperone. Squared!" </p>
	<p><a href="signup.html">Sign up</a> by April 16 for tickets, using the activity code 
	<span class="label">"Something Rotten."</span>
