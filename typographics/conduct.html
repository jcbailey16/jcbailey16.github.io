		<h1 class="small">Code of Conduct</h1>
		<p>All participants of our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. 
		Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants 
		to help ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for everyone.</p>

		<p>Need Help? Contact <a href="cara@cooper.edu">cara@cooper.edu</a>, or ask any conference staff to assist. 
		Conference staff and volunteers can be identified by their badges. School security will be in uniform and present 
		throughout the venue.</p>
		
		<p>Please be respectful of all present. Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience 
		for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion 
		(or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Conference participants violating 
		these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
		
		<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, 
		race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained 
		disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
		
		<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. 
		If anyone engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or 
		expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, 
		please contact a member of conference staff or security immediately.</p>
		
		<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those 
		experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
