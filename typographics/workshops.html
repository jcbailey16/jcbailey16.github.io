				<h2>Introduction to Hand Lettering with James Edmondson</h2>
				<p>In this 4 day workshop, students will learn from the ground up how to sketch letters, make 
				refinements, and produce a finished analog or digital piece. Standard drawing tools will be used 
				to test ideas and push various parameters, though no art or design background is required. This 
				course covers the fundamentals for whichever styles students care to pursue, as well as techniques 
				for harmonious compositions, and eye-catching effects.</p>

				<h2>Integrating Letter and Image with Michael Doret</h2>
				<p>Have you ever designed a headline that needed an image, or worked on an illustration that needed a 
				headline—but thought creating and putting the two together could be problematic? It can be pretty 
				disappointing when letter and image come from two different sources—and are just slapped one over the 
				other! This workshop will help you uncover ways that your work can actually be stronger when you discover 
				how to successfully integrate these forms with each other—as they are two sides of the same coin. The 
				purpose of this four-day workshop is to demonstrate how the rules governing letter and image can be bent 
				and how the two can be fused to create new hybrid forms.</p>
				
				<p>Participants will select and work on at least two of several assignment options, and receive constructive 
				feedback at various stages during the workshop. These stages can include research, rough pencil thumbnails, 
				development sketches, and refinement and execution of final artwork. This work may take the form of finished 
				drawings, be brought into the digital realm, or completed using traditional media. By the end of the class 
				students should have a better understanding of—and the ability to take advantage of—the complex relationship 
				between letterforms and imagery.</p>

				<p>In this one day workshop, participants have a unique opportunity to have their own RoboFont production 
				and workflow problems solved by way of a live coding demonstration by Frederik Berlaen, with assistance by 
				Andy Clymer. While Python programming knowledge is helpful for the workshop, it isn’t required of the 
				participants. But, abstract thinking is a must. Wondering how to make variable fonts? Problems with 
				getting started with a project? Workflow feels like it needs optimizing? Wonder what you could really 
				be doing with Python? Bring a problem!</p>

				are design processes so non-linear even when design thinking is? How can designers work better as teams? Can 
				you balance on the wrong foot? Why should you never participate in pitches? You will get amazing insight 
				these matters. Never to forget.</p>

				outline constructions, extrapolation and designspace planning. We’ll use Superpolator and RoboFont, and maybe 
				also a bit of python. Basic digital drawing skills required.</p>

				In this workshop students will learn how to create and implement Spencerian Lettering for various design applications.</p>

				<h2>Whispering Type with Frederik Berlaen</h2>
				<p>In this 3 day workshop, students approach the practice of typeface design by looking at type and the 
				shapes within. Through research and analysis of shapes you will learn the language of letter forms both 
				on a visual and on a narrative level. By sketching and drawing digitally an alphabet will be completed. 
				At the end participants will have an ‘unfinished’ typeface with lowercase or uppercase letters. But each 
				one will be forced to draw something different than they are used to.</p>

				<p>Did you ever wonder why existing design tools make you do so much repetitive work? Why is it difficult 
				to get back to sketching once your design tools take over? This workshop is intended for designers who want 
				to code and for developers who want to design. Even if you decide that coding your designs isn’t what you 
				want to do yourself, you will learn how to talk to developers.</p>
